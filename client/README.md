# Client

Client side of the application doesnt require any specific configuration. All you need is to install all dependencies.

### Project requirements:

To install all dependencies use a command:

`npm i`

To run the app use command:

`npm run dev`

And for this part of the app that would be all. Server side requires a bit more setup. For more information follow the corresponding readme file.
