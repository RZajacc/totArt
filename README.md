* **Client** side of the application is built with React and Vite, Typescript, and Bootstrap.
* **Server** side is built with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
  
<p>Current version of the app is available [here](https://github.com/RZajacc/totArt_v.2.0).</p>

### Description:

Project is made for users the users to share some interesting locations around Berlin. It is not about the fancy places that everyone knows, quite the contrary, more about small things that draws our attention and we find cool. Small things that get forgotten few minutes after they are being seen but we think desire some attention. The name refers to the tip of The Tongue phenomenon, where a person fails to retrieve some word or term from memory, combined with partial recall and feeling that retrieval is imminent. Here it refers to those places and this app aims to adress this issue and keep the memory alive.
Before you start using the application check README files in corresponding sections of the app (client and server).

> [!NOTE]
> Main goal of the project is to learn, so any tips are welcome!
